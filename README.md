# ArtificialEye_v2

An artificial eye to be used as the perception system for an artificial neural-network controlled 3D human model.
This repo contains the mesh generator, an OpenGL renderer for debugging, a soft-body simulation system, and a ray-tracer.
The ray tracer is done in parallel.

Another version with an improved soft-body system and ray-tracer is in the works for SIGGRAPH 2019.
